Some notes on using this code:

- before use, modify base_path in config.py to point at your working directory.

- in your working directory, you should create the following sub-folders: 
-- output_lcs/
-- plot_outputs/
-- tables/

- you'll also need the light curves output by k2phot somewhere on your computer

- c4_script.py is the wrapper around the other codes. It will run a single star or a list of stars through this code. 

- If you want to run a set of stars, use c4_lcs_aps.csv as an example. You can also just use a list of light curves and EPIC IDs. Put the full path to each file under the header "filename", and the EPIC numbers under "EPIC".

- dependencies: astropy, matplotlib, numpy, scipy, astroML
